   * * 9: An INT32 value, specifying the depthwise multiplier.
   * * 10: An INT32 value, and has to be one of the {@link FuseCode} values.
   *       Specifies the activation to invoke on the result of each addition.
   *
   * Inputs (implicit padding):
   * * 0: A 4-D tensor, of shape [batches, height, width, depth_in], specifying the input.
   * * 1: A 4-D tensor, of shape [1, filter_height, filter_width, depth_out],
   *      specifying the filter.
   * * 2: A 1-D tensor, of shape [depth_out], specifying the bias.
   *      For input tensor of {@link TENSOR_FLOAT32} type, the bias should
   *      also be of {@link TENSOR_FLOAT32}.
   *      For input tensor of {@link TENSOR_QUANT8_ASYMM} type, the bias
   *      should be of {@link TENSOR_INT32}, with zeroPoint of 0 and
   *      bias_scale == input_scale * filter_scale.
   * * 3: An INT32 value, specifying the implicit padding scheme, has to be one of the
   *      {@link PaddingCode} values.
   * * 4: An INT32 value, specifying the dilation rate in the ‘width’ dimension.
   * * 5: An INT32 value, specifying the dilation rate in the ‘height’ dimension.
   * * 6: An INT32 value, specifying the depthwise multiplier.
   * * 7: An INT32 value, and has to be one of the {@link FuseCode} values.
   *       Specifies the activation to invoke on the result of each addition.
   *
   * Outputs:
   * * 0: The output 4-D tensor, of shape [batches, out_height, out_width, depth_out].
   *      For output tensor of {@link TENSOR_QUANT8_ASYMM} type, the following
   *      condition must be satisfied: output_scale > input_scale * filter_scale.
